# Retail Sales Azure Data Pipeline 🚀

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering solution using the Azure Data Platform. We simulate a retail business scenario where sales data is extracted, transformed, loaded, and visualized through a scalable cloud-first architecture.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Azure Data Factory** – Orchestrates ETL workflows
- **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** – Stores data using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers)
- **Azure Databricks** – Data transformation with PySpark
- **SQL (Azure Synapse / Azure SQL DB)** – Aggregation and analysis
- **Power BI** – Business insight dashboards
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and collaboration

---

## 🚀 Project Summary

The goal is to build a scalable data pipeline that:
